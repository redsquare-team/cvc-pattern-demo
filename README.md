# CVC (Context View Controller) pattern for ReactJS 16.6+

CVC (Context View Controller) is an experimental pattern that i've formalized that helps you to create 
extremely reusable and extendible components with latest React version without use any other library. 

In this example i've implemented a modal with CVC pattern for React 16.6 usingSMART and DUMB components 
that interacts with each other via new Context API and render props pattern.
It also provides a wrapper method to fully extends this component via Decorator pattern 
(aka High order Component in React) if needed.

These sources also contains an example of how to use Context API to replace Redux in most cases.
